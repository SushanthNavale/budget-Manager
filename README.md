The website allows staff to login and add budgets, in order to generate a report, where the admin verifies it and generates an overall report. 
# The options provided by this website include add budget, view budget and update consumed amount, for the staff side. Compare budget, view budget, send notification through mail to staff and generate report, for the admin side.
# The Administrator can login and add new staff, delete staff, view budget added by staff, generate report and send notification through mail to staffs.
